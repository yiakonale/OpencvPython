# OpencvPython
Learning OpenCV with Python. Each chapter has a new feature which eventually is included into the 3 projects.

Here is a summary of what each chapter introduces:
1. *capturing video with a webcam and formatting the display window*
2. *converting an image to greyscale, bluring, edge detection and image manipulation*
3. *cropping and resizing an image*
4. *displaying shapes and graphics on a window*
5. *converting a perspective image to a proper display*
6. *implementing the stack algorithm `stacked.py`*
    * _stacking multiple windows into one window for a cleaner look_
7. *creating sliders to adjust hue, saturation and color value for an image to create specific color masks*
8. *identifying simple shapes in an image, drawing bounding boxes, and displaying what the shape is depending on the number of edges detected*
9. *using the haar cascades to detect faces and draw bounding boxes around them*

* **project 1:** using basic color detection to create virtual color markers overlay on real-time webcam display

* **project 2:** a digital document scanner, able to read and properly display documents from warped perspectives

* **project 3:** car licence plate detector, with the ability to grab and save a proper photo of the licence plate automatically



These learning modules can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQeoO7MI0Bs). The objective was to learn OpenCV by following the above tutorial, so the code is vasty similar to the YouTube video
